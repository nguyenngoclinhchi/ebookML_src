    "# NumPy and pandas working together\n",
    "Pandas depends upon and interoperates with NumPy, the Python library for fast numeric array computations. For example, you can use the DataFrame attribute .values to represent a DataFrame `df` as a NumPy array. You can also pass pandas data structures to NumPy methods. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and loaded world population data every 10 years since 1960 into the DataFrame df. This dataset was derived from the one used in the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to extract the values and store them in an array using the attribute .values. You'll then use those values as input into the NumPy `np.log10()` method to compute the base 10 logarithm of the population values. Finally, you will pass the entire pandas DataFrame into the same NumPy `np.log10()` method and compare the results."
